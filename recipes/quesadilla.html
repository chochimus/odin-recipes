    <h2>It's about to get serious</h2>
    <p>Picture this: you're at your house awaiting the arrival of a girl you've 
        recently been talking to. She is under the assumption that you're preparing
        an incredible dinner. Only problem is, you can't cook. 
    </p>
    <p>Allow me to introduce you to the pièce de résistance. The single most powerful
        weapon at the disposal of anyone,<strong> ever</strong>. This is... the cheese
        quesadilla.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A Quesadilla</li>
        <li>like a tablespoon of butter I guess</li>
        <li>that one Mexican style four cheese blend from Kraft</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>First you're gonna want to heat the pan up to medium, go ahead 
            and toss in the butter while you're at it and coat the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the butter is melted just toss the quesadilla in there and
            maybe like a handful of cheese, I don't know, whatever feels right.
        </li>
        <li>
            wait until the cheese starts to melt then fold it in half.
            Leave it on each side until it's a nice golden brown. Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
